But all this hurrying and trying to achieve much with very little effort is reflected in the quality of our food. And 'man is what he eats'. Therefore, if the twentieth century was marked by the influence of modern chemistry, in the twenty-first century people turn back to old time food quality. The mania on fast food gradually shifts from the pleasures of slow food. And what pleasure can there be in a rapidly grown and forcefully ripened tomato? So, by necessity, we need to replace the word 'chemical' in our food with 'biological' (or 'organic').",

Later it reaches the inner part of the continent, where in the early 30s of last century was produced industrially in the USSR (Altai region, which currently has over 6,000 ha), and later in Russia, Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, Germany, Canada, USA, Denmark, Sweden and others.",
                "p-2": "In our country the first studies of culture in order to clarify the ability to be grown in Bulgaria started in the 60s. In the late 70s of last century were created the first state orchards from chokeberry in almost all regional cities. Engines of this process became two agronomic research institutes - Institute for Alpine Agriculture in Lovech and Fruit Growers Institute in Plovdiv. Especially extensive scientific studies have been made at the Supreme Forest Research Institute in Sofia, from a young student at the time, Dimitar Stoyanov, who after defending his dissertation on this plant became a professor at the same institute."

Before the main treatment mainly fertilization is done (in option). In bio-farming mineral fertilizers are replaced with manure, compost or biohumus imported at the rate of 6-8 tons per decare or 8-10 kg of propagation pit. Best time for planting aronia is in autumn, 2-3 weeks before the permanent frost of the soil. The most common planting distance between rows is 3.5-4 m, and inside the lines - 2,5 m.

                "p-prun": "During the formation of the aronia bush pruning is more moderate in order not to grow many shoots. The highlight of the newly planted plants with 6-7 buds are cut. Then each year 4-5 new shoots are left and surpluses are removed. During the first 6-7 years after planting, major fruit-bearing branches shall not be removed. Only the weak, broken and lying on the soil surface shoots are removed. The proper pruning starts on the 6th or 7th year after planting and aims lightening and rejuvenation of the bush. Aronia, especially the bush type, is predisposed to bearing the fruit in the top. This leads to an extension of the branches that dip into the soil and so reduce yields and the fruit becomes petty. The purpose of pruning is to keep balance between the different age shoots in the bush; the shoots number should be around 30-35."

In the late 70s of last century were created the first state orchards from chokeberry in almost all regional cities. Engines of this process became two agronomic research institutes - Institute for Alpine Agriculture in Lovech and Fruit Growers Institute in Plovdiv.

Best time for planting aronia is in autumn, 2-3 weeks before the permanent frost of the soil. The most common planting distance between rows is 3.5-4 m, and inside the lines - 2,5 m.

Only the weak, broken and lying on the soil surface shoots are removed. The proper pruning starts on the 6th or 7th year after planting and aims lightening and rejuvenation of the bush. Aronia, especially the bush type, is predisposed to bearing the fruit in the top. This leads to an extension of the branches that dip into the soil and so reduce yields and the fruit becomes petty. The purpose of pruning is to keep balance between the different age shoots in the bush; the shoots number should be around 30-35."
